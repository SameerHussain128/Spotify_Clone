Title: Spotify Clone Web Application

This project is a fully functional Spotify clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the core features of the Spotify music player, allowing users to play songs with an intuitive interface. Key functionalities include:

Playback Controls: Users can play, pause, and navigate through tracks.

Volume Control: Adjust the volume easily with a dedicated slider.

Song Timeline: Users can seek through songs using a timeline slider.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be user-friendly across various devices.
This project showcases my skills in front-end web development and serves as a practical example of building a music player application. The code is available for collaboration and further development on GitHub. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use it as a learning resource!
